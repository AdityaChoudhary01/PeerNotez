            Angel Falls, known as "Salto Ángel" in Spanish, is the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall, located in Venezuela's Canaima National Park. It plunges 979 meters (3,212 feet) from the Auyán-tepui mountain. The falls are named after Jimmy Angel, an American aviator who was the first to fly over them in 1933. The water cascades over the edge of the tepui, creating a breathtaking sight that attracts adventurers and nature lovers from around the globe. The surrounding area is rich in biodiversity and indigenous culture, making it a UNESCO World Heritage site.
