<h1>The Machu Picchu</h1>
          <p id="2">
                <font face="jokerman" size="3">Machu Picchu is located in Cuzco, the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a height of 7,970 feet mountain ridge. It is a 15th-century Inca citadel, It is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The world most archaeologists accept that site was constructed as an estate for the emperor of Inca Pachacuti around the year 1450 & abandoned a century later at the time of Spanish defeat. But the Spanish had no idea about its existence of it and it was getting international attention in 1911 when American historian Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu was built with polished dry-stone walls. It is one of the few pre-Columbian ruins found undamaged. Without being affected by its relative isolation high in the Andes Mountains, it characterises agricultural terraces, residential areas, temples and plazas. Machu Picchu was declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1983 and declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981.</font> </p>
